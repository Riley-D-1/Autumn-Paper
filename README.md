# Autumn-Paper
A website that has randomly falling leaves and is heavily aesthetic and works with lively wallpaper.


### Why did I make Autumn-Paper?
- I use a wallpaper software called lively that supports websites as a source and wanted to make my own wallpaper and thought it would be a fun project to continue my JS skills
### Demo Instructions:
Simply visit the website - (link goes here)
