# Autumn-Paper
A website that has randomly falling leaves and is heavily aesthetic and works with lively wallpaper.

### Why did I make Autumn-Paper?
- I use a wallpaper software called lively that supports websites as a source and wanted to make my own wallpaper and thought it would be a fun project to continue my JS skills.


### Important
- This was a 6hr project and my JS skills still suck lol
- I understand it's not particularly impresive but I had exams so no time for siege this week, so meceneraies covered the hours this week lol. 

### Demo Instructions:
NOTE THAT THIS WAS  CODED AROUND 1080P resolution and may not be amazing on other resolutions
Simply visit the website - [Link](https://riley-d-1.github.io/Autumn-Paper/)

Alternatively you can also use lively and add the wallpaper to experience it in your own way. In Lively wallpaper click the add wallpaper button and paste the website link https://riley-d-1.github.io/Autumn-Paper/, give it your own title and it will work automatically
## Credit
There is an inspiration folder that I used to help stylise the tree but the tree is my own work. Massive thanks to those artists to inspiring my own art.
